Gopong
======

This is a minimal pong game written with the intention to practise the
Go programming language and to see how it interacts with C
libraries. It uses allegro <http://liballeg.org> for the lowlevel
drawing.

Ensure you have allegro installed, then compile and run the game:

  $ go build
  $ ./gopong
